The NumPy library contains multidimensional array data structures,
such as the homogeneous, N-dimensional ndarray , and a large library of
functions that operate efficiently on these data structures.
Numpy is a general-purpose array-processing package. It provides a 
high-performance multidimensional array object, and tools for working 
with these arrays. It is the fundamental package for scientific computing with Python.
